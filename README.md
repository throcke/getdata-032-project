# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

- CodeBook.md: Description of dataset and variables 
- Run_Analysis.r: a script that creates a tiny dataset
- Tiny Set: extracted only mean/stdev values from original set
 
# Project Directions

- You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
